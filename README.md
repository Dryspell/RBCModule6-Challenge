# RBCModule6-Challenge

This project exemplifies usage of Google API and Open Weather API to acquire data, filter results by user criteria and output presentable maps for use. Along the way, we created three deliverables:
1. The  [WeatherPy_Database.csv](/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv) generated by the [Weather_Database.ipynb](Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb), data taken from OpenWeatherAPI, which outputs weather in cities closest to x number of random lattitues and longitudes across the globe, where x is user inputted.  
2. The [WeatherPy_vacation.csv](Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_Database.csv) generated by the [Vacation_Search.ipynb](Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb) which outputs lists of potentially viable hotels from the cities above within a specified temperature range.

3. The ulitmate result is a randomized vacation with x number of hotel stops in either a randomized or specified country from hotels listed in **Deliverable#2**.

We produce this selection in [Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb](Vacation_Itinerary/Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb). The notable methods we wrote and use are:
-  `get_random_itinerary(number,country)` - creates a random itinerary with a specified number and within a specified country. If country == "" a random one is chosen. 
- `draw_itinerary(dataframe, style)` - draws the map for the given Itinerary. only requires that the dataframe have columns 'Lat' and 'Lng'. Style has options "one-way" or default:"loop". 
- `get_random_sorted_itinerary(number,country,style)` - combines the above two methods to yield the ultimate result. Run this command in a new cell with desired specifications. 

Obviously, we went far above and beyond the requirements of this Challenge by refactoring much as methods, adding resuability for variable number of stops, country, etc. and by implementing a naive traveling salesman problem solution to solving the shortest route between the cities.
